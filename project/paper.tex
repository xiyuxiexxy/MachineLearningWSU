% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Problem of Naive Bayes Classifier}
\section{Methodology}
Our idea was coming form the quantum mechanics, it said that for each particle to be at some place with some attribute can be determinated using a probabilist approach. It is not an stupid idea to believe that human activities behave like quantum particles, since we human are just a bigger particle.

The idea of our methods is believing that human activity happened in a probabilist way. This is saying that if a person is running, his/her acceleration and his/her orientation must be some kind of probability distribution. This is idea also indicated that the probability of he/she is running must be some kind  of probability distribution.

Giving these two assumptions we can simply build a Bayes classifier to find out which activity a person is more like to be doing. For example: If a person $A$ is doing a event $E$, then we should have $P$($X$:attributes $|$ $E$ and $A$) and we should also have $P(E | A)$. With these two probability we could find out the probability of $P$($E$ $|$ $X$ and $A$), simply use the Bayes theorem. We then can determinate which is more likely to be the event that $A$ is doing given attributes $X$. 

However, there are two conflicts here, attributes $X$ may not be independent to each others and attributes may not be a simple single-mean distribution.  In order for Naive Bayes classifier to work, first we must apply PCA on the raw data to remove the dependency between each attributes which make them non-correlated to each others. Another step we must do is to use the Expected Maximum method to find multi-mean Gaussian fit for each attributes, which is saying all $P(X_{i}|E)$ is fitted by multi-mean Gaussian.

Out methods contain three different hierarchies: simple, monitored, and regular. The reason to have three different hierarchies is because we were trying to improve the accuracy by setting some parameters limitation and pre-processing the data.
\section{Algorithm and Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item [I] Simple algorithm
\begin{itemize}
\item [Step 1] : Apply PCA on the training data
\item [Step 2] : Group the same event together
\item [Step 3] : Run Expected mean to find the multi-Gaussian distribution for each attribute within each  event
\item [Step 4]: Predict the event with test data using the naive Bayes. Calculate the P(E|X) using the distribution on Step(3), picking the label with highest probability, $\theta_{MAP}$.
\end{itemize}
The simple algorithm simply applied our method on the the raw data without any pre-process nor limitation. We were as naive as naive Bayes classifier, the accuracy is lower than 1\%. The result is bad is because we originally believe that using the multi-Gaussian distribution will remove the noise or at least reduce the impact of noise. However, using the EM method to find a multi-Gaussian fit causing us a huge trouble, since EM method tried to optimize the fit, or say minimized the distance. 
Without giving it a upper bond or lower bond on clusters, it can act funny. For example, given an event $E_{1}$ with a large variance on attribute $X_{1}$ and an event $E_{2}$ with a small variance on attribute $X_{1}$, the EM is tend to over fit the attribute $X_{1}$ of $E_{1}$ with too many means, which causing $E_{1}$ always have the highest probability regardless the value of $X_{1}$.  See figure 1 and 2, we can see that event 5 are the most dominate since they have highest False Positive.\\

\item [II] Monitored algorithm
\begin{itemize}
\item [Step 0]  : For each event we have $L_{E_{1}}$ to upper bond number of Gaussian fit on attributes, originally set to 9.
\item [Step 1]  : Apply PCA on the training data
\item [Step 2]  : Group the same activities together
\item [Step 3]  : Run Expected mean with limited number to find the L-Gaussian distribution for each attribute within each  event
\item [Step 4]  : Predict the event with test data using the naive Bayes. Calculate the $P(E|X)$ using the distribution on Step(3), picking the label with highest probability, $\theta_{MAP}$.
\item [Step 5]  : Calculate the confusion matrix to see which event has the highest false positive, reduce its L and re-run the algorithm at Step 1
\end{itemize}
To fix the problem we encountered with simple algorithm. First we remove the NULL event from the raw data since it does not make sense to keep it. Then we propose a second algorithm to put a limitation on the number of Gaussian fit. Putting these limitation improve the accuracy, because  the distribution of attributes' value are more significantly different for different events, see figure 3. However, there are two difficulties about this method. First, this method is not complete, setting single $L$ value to each event is just an approximate. In order to do the exact correct method, we should have $D$ $L$ values for each event, where $D$ is  number of attributes. It is saying that each event should have different limitation on each attributes. 
Another  difficulties about this method is the prediction time. The prediction time (Step 4) for all three of our approaches are tremendously long, prediction on a Leave-one-day-out case require more than 24hrs. This problem explain why we did not try to implement a $D$-$L$ complete monitored algorithm. This problem even prevent us from running the whole monitored algorithm, we only do a fixed set of $L$ values to see the impact. However, we believe given us more time and more powerful CPUs, the $D$-$L$ complete monitored algorithm can be implemented, since it is really easy to be paralleled.\\

\item [III] Regular algorithm
\begin{itemize}
\item [Step 0] : Divide input into days. Find the regular days ( remove those with less than 3 activities) and use only the regular days as input.
\item [Step 1] : Apply PCA on the training data
\item [Step 2] : Group the same activities together
\item [Step 3] : Run Expected mean with limited number to find the $L$-Gaussian distribution for each attribute within each  event
\item [Step 4] : Predict the event with test data using the naive Bayes. Calculate the $P(E|X)$ using the distribution on Step(3), picking the label with highest probability, $\theta_{MAP}$.
\end{itemize}
Since the prediction time (Step 4) is causing us to have big issue on maximize the $L$ parameters, we take a different approach on looking at this problem. We trimmed the input size down to only the regular day, which make sense since activities recolonization is based on some regularity of a person's behavior. Combining the idea of monitored algorithm, we use some fixed $L$ that we observer from previous test experiment with only the regular day input, the result accuracy should be higher. 
The way we define a regular day is to compare all different days by observation. First divide the data into days using the time stamp provided in the first column, then we find a regular day based on the average of activities performed in one day. For example if a person perform average 7 events everyday, then a day with only 3 events is not an regular day for this person, which we consider it as a noise day. With this idea, we are more emphasize on a regular behavior of each person.
\end{itemize}
